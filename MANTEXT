NAME
       fauxdacious - a fork of the Audacious audio player.

SYNOPSIS
       fauxdacious [option ...] [file | url ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Fauxdacious  is  a  free advanced media player for Linux and many other
       UNIX-compatible systems.  Fauxdacious is a fork of the Audacious  audio
       player  and  adds  many  new  features  including  video  and DVD play,
       restoration of XMMS file and song-specific equalizer  presets  and  ef-
       fects  plugins,  full Unix-ish piping support for stdin and stdout, and
       much more!

OPTIONS
   Getting help:
       -h, --help
              Show a brief list of options.

   Opening files:
       -c, --clear
              Start up with empty current playlist.

       -D, --delete
              Delete all playlists - particularly useful when using the Winamp
              Skin  interface,  which  only shows a single playlist so that no
              hidden ones remain.  This ensures starting  up  with  no  hidden
              playlists!

       -e, --enqueue
              Add the files on the command line to the current playlist but do
              not start playback.

       -E, --enqueue-to-temp
              Add the files  on  the  command  line  to  the  ``Now  Playing''
              playlist and start playback.

   Controlling playback:
       -f, --fwd
              Skip to the next song in the playlist.

       -p, --play
              Start  playback.   If paused, playback will resume from the same
              point.  If already active and not paused, it will  restart  from
              the beginning of the song.

       -P, --pause-mute
              Pause mutes current instance instead of pausing.

       -r, --rew
              Skip to the previous song in the playlist.

       -s, --stop
              Stop playback.

       -t, --play-pause
              Equivalent to --pause if playback is active, otherwise --play.

       -u, --pause
              Pause playback, or resume if already paused.

   Miscellaneous:
       -a, --add-list[="playlist name"]
              Add  Playlist:  Each  use creates a new playlist (for subsequent
              entry arguments).

       -g, --gain
              Fudge Additional Gain Adjustment (all entries).

       -G, --gtk
              Start up in GTK mode (see also -Q for Qt mode).

       -H, --headless
              Start in command-line mode; i.e., without any graphical user in-
              terface.

       -j, --show-jump-box
              Show the Jump to Song window.

       -m, --show-main-window
              Show  the Fauxdacious window if it is hidden and bring it to the
              top.

       -o, --out=ext
              Starts Fauxdacious with Filewriter  as  the  output  plugin  and
              sends  audio  to stdout using the format specified by the exten-
              sion ("ext"), which can be "wav", "mp3", "ogg", or  "flac".   If
              just  -o is given, then "wav" is used.  After Fauxdacious exits,
              the audio output plugin and recording settings are  restored  to
              their previous (normal listening) values.

       -q, --quit-after-play
              Exit as soon as playback stops, or immediately if there is noth-
              ing to play.

       -Q, --qt
              Start up in Qt mode (see also -G for GTK mode).

       -R, --force_recording
              Force Recording ON on startup.

       -v, --version
              Print version information and exit.

       -V, --verbose
              Print debugging output while running (may be used twice for even
              more output).

       -z, --no-equalizer
              Force Equalizer Off on startup.

       -#, -n, --new=instancename
              Starts  a  new  instance.   The new instance started may be con-
              trolled with: fauxdtool  instance  instancename.   Copy  ~/.con-
              fig/fauxdacious/config to ~/.config/fauxdacious-instancename and
              edit to tailor configuration.  -n creates a new unnamed instance
              that  can  not be controlled by audtool.  New instances can also
              be created and contolled the  Audacious  way  with  single-digit
              numbers (1-9), ie. -1, -2, etc.
