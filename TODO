* (Qt): Make Effects plugin screen (checkboxes) update when song change (with
custom equalizer and effects settings) changes the active effects plugins.
The effect plugins get properly turned off and on, but the QT screen does NOT
update the checkboxes unless you click on the screen.  So far I have not
found a way to fix this minor annoyance.

* (Qt): Deal with occasional crashes on exit related to interaction between 
the Info-bar and Mini-Fauxdacious, though non-technical users may not actually 
notice the difference between such "crashes" and normal exits.

* (M$-Windows): Rebuild build-environment to enable building the Qt version for 
Windows (currently GTK only) and upgrading many ancient library versions.
Also try to fix Fauxdacious icon disappearance when toggling 
[View]."Show Menu Bar" on, then back off.
