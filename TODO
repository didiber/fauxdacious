* (Qt): Make Effects plugin screen (checkboxes) update when song change (with
custom equalizer and effects settings) changes the active effects plugins.
The effect plugins get properly turned off and on, but the QT screen does NOT
update the checkboxes unless you click on the screen.  So far I have not
found a way to fix this minor annoyance.

* (M$-Windows): Rebuild build-environment to enable building the Qt version for 
Windows (currently GTK only) and upgrading many ancient library versions.
Also try to fix Fauxdacious icon disappearance when toggling 
[View]."Show Menu Bar" on, then back off.
