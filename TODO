* (Qt): Make Effects plugin screen (checkboxes) update when song change (with
custom equalizer and effects settings) changes the active effects plugins.
The effect plugins get properly turned off and on, but the QT screen does NOT
update the checkboxes unless you click on the screen.  So far I have not
found a way to fix this annoyance.

* Remove Adplug Classic plugin when Debian FINALLY gets around to patching
or upgrading Adplug.  But may just leave in anyway! :)
