#USER: EDIT THIS FILE TO:
#ADD STREAMING STATIONS THAT SWITCH BACK TO THEIR STATION TITLE NEAR END OF 
#SONG BEFORE SWITCHING TO NEXT SONG IN ORDER TO AVOID RE-SEARCHING 
#MUSIC-BRAINZ FOR LIKELY NON-EXISTANT "TITLE" EVERY SONG!
#FORMAT:  [skip=]'album name|title name' [, ...]
#GENERAL FORMAT (SEE OPTIONS BELOW):  [skip=|notagart=|noalbum=|noartist=]'album name[|title name'] [, ...]
#NOTE:  "album name" IS THE STATION'S DEFAULT NAME IN THE ALBUM FIELD.

#SOME STATIONS ALSO SEND THEIR STATION'S ICON IMAGE WITH EVERY SONG WHICH CAN
#BREAK (IGNORE) FAUXDACIOUS ALBUM-ART PLUGIN'S "Hide info bar art icon unless separate album cover fetched"
#OPTION IF FAUXDACIOUS ALREADY HAS A STATION IMAGE ON FILE FOR THAT STATION.
#THIS CAN BE WORKED AROUND USING LINE FORMAT:  notagart='album name|_' [, ...]
#OR:  notagart='station_default_image.url'.

#YOU CAN ALSO SAVE HITS ON MusicBrainz BY PREVENTING ALBUM-SEARCH FOR STREAMING
#STATIONS THAT DON'T PROVIDE REAL ALBUM NAMES (MOST) WITH THE LINE FORMAT:
#noalbum='station album name'
# -or-
#noartist='artist name'

#NOTE:  "_" (WILDCARD) MATCHES ANY.
