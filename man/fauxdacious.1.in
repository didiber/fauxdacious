.SH OPTIONS
.SS Getting help:

.TP
.B -h, --help
Show a brief list of options.

.SS Opening files:

.TP
.B -e, --enqueue
Add the files on the command line to the current playlist but do not start
playback.

Add the files on the command line to the ``Now Playing'' playlist and start
playback.
.TP
.B -c, --clear
Start up with empty current playlist.
.TP
.B -D, --delete
Delete all playlists - particularly useful when using the Winamp Skin
interface, which only shows a single playlist so that no hidden ones remain.
This ensures starting up with no hidden playlists!

.SS Controlling playback:

.TP
.B -p, --play
Start playback.  If paused, playback will resume from the same point.  If
already active and not paused, it will restart from the beginning of the song.
.TP
.B -u, --pause
Pause playback, or resume if already paused.
.TP
.B -P, --pause-mute
Pause mutes current instance instead of pausing.
.TP

Equivalent to \fB--pause\fR if playback is active, otherwise \fB--play\fR.
.TP
.B -s, --stop
Stop playback.
.TP
.B -r, --rew
Skip to the previous song in the playlist.
.TP
.B -f, --fwd

.TP
.B -j, --show-jump-box
Show the Jump to Song window.
.TP
.B -H, --headless
Start in command-line mode; i.e., without any graphical user interface.
.TP
.B -q, --quit-after-play

.TP
.B -v, --version
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.B -V, --verbose
Print debugging output while running (may be used twice for even more output).
.TP
.B -#, -n, --new=instancename
Starts a new instance.  The new instance started may be controlled with:
\fBfauxdtool instance instancename\fR.  Copy ~/.config/fauxdacious/config
to ~/.config/fauxdacious/instancename and edit to tailor configuration.
-n creates a new unnamed instance that can not be controlled by audtool.
New instances can also be created and contolled the Audacious way with
single-digit numbers (1-9), ie. -1, -2, etc.
.TP
.B -o, --out=ext
Starts Fauxdacious with Filewriter as the output plugin and sends audio to
stdout using the format specified by the extension ("ext"), which can be
"wav", "mp3", "ogg", or "flac".  If just -o is given, then "wav" is used.
After Fauxdacious exits, the audio output plugin and recording settings are
restored to their previous (normal listening) values.
.TP
.B -z, --no-equalizer
Force Equalizer Off on startup.
