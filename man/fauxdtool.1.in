.SH NAME
.B fauxdtool
- a small tool to control Fauxdacious from the command line.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fauxdtool
[-# | [--]\fBinstance\fR \fIinstance-name\fR] [--]\fBcommand\fR [\fIparameter\fR ...] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fauxdtool
sends commands to a running instance of Fauxdacious.
.PP
It can send many common commands, such as to skip to the next song in the
playlist, and can also print status information, such as the title of the
current song.
.PP
\fIinstance\fR may be given as \fB-#\fR or \fBinstance-name\fR to specify which
instance of Fauxdacious to control when multiple instances have been started
(with \fB--new=instance-name\fR).  The \fBinstance-name\fR will also be the
name of the config directory (created first time the instance is started, if not
already existing) as ~/.config/fauxdacious[_instancename]/.  (The default config
file instance name is \fBfauxdacious\fR), but the default config directory is
~/.config/fauxdacious, not ~/.config/fauxdacious_fauxdacious).  New unnamed
instances (created with just \fB-n\fR) can not be manipulated with fauxdtool.
\fBinstance-name\fR is just a user-selected unique string of characters (or
single-digit number).  Instances can also be specified as single-digit numbers
(-#) as is done in Audacious.
